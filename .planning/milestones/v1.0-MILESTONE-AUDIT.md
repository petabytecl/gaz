# Milestone v1 Audit Report

**Status:** ✓ PASSED
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Verifier:** gsd-orchestrator

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1 (Core Framework) has been successfully verified. All planned phases are complete, all requirements are satisfied, and the components are correctly integrated. The framework delivers a cohesive Developer Experience (DX) connecting DI, Lifecycle, Config, Health, and Logging.

## Requirements Coverage

**Total Requirements:** 35
**Satisfied:** 35 (100%)
**Unsatisfied:** 0

| Category | Reqs | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| DI Container | 9 | ✓ Full | Core generic container working perfectly |
| Lifecycle | 8 | ✓ Full | Deterministic start/stop with signal handling |
| App Builder | 6 | ✓ Full | Fluent API and Cobra integration verified |
| Configuration | 3 | ✓ Full | Env, Files, Flags (Cobra) all working |
| Health Checks | 5 | ✓ Full | Liveness/Readiness/Startup endpoints active |
| Logging | 4 | ✓ Full | Slog integration with context propagation complete |

## Phase Verification

All 10 phases (6 major + 4 sub-phases) have passed verification.

| 04 | Config System | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-26 |
| 04.1 | Refactor Configuration | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-26 |
| 05 | Health Checks | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-26 |
| 06 | Logging (slog) | ✓ Passed | 2026-01-26 |

## Integration & E2E Flows

**Integration Checker Verdict:** PASSED

### Wiring Verified
- **App → Logger:** Logger initializes and propagates via Context and DI.
- **App → Config:** ConfigManager loads from all sources and binds to CLI flags.
- **App → Health:** Management server starts alongside app services.
- **DI Container:** Successfully resolves all core framework components.

### Golden Path Verified
The primary user journey was validated:
1. `gaz.New()`
2. `.WithConfig()`
3. `.WithHealthChecks()`
4. `.WithCobra()`
5. `cmd.Execute()` (Build -> Start -> Run -> Stop)

## Tech Debt & Observations

Non-blocking items for future consideration:

1. **Health Configuration:** `WithHealthChecks` takes a static config struct, which means health settings (like port) can't easily be overridden by the general Config system (files/env) because `gaz.New` runs before config loading.
   *Recommendation:* In v2, consider a `HealthConfigProvider` or lazy config resolution.

2. **Documentation Stale:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` lists Logging requirements as "Pending" even though they are implemented.
   *Recommendation:* Update `REQUIREMENTS.md` during milestone completion.

## Conclusion

The `gaz` framework v1 is feature-complete and stable. It meets its core value proposition of a "Simple, type-safe dependency injection with sane defaults."

**Result:** READY FOR RELEASE
