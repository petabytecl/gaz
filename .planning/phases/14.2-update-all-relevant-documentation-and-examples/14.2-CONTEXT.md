# Phase 14.2: Update All Relevant Documentation and Examples - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Update all documentation (README, godoc, examples) to reflect changes from phases 11-14.4: the generic fluent API (`For[T]()`), extracted DI/Config packages, Workers package, and updated config patterns. This is a documentation refresh, not feature work.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Documentation scope
- Full overhaul of README, godoc comments, and all examples
- Claude decides update order based on what's most stale/broken
- Maintain current depth level — fix accuracy, don't expand scope
- Delete stale documentation entirely rather than deprecation notices

### Example strategy
- Rewrite examples from scratch to showcase current API (not patch existing)
- Keep current example structure (one per feature)
- Keep current complexity level
- All examples must compile AND run successfully

### Migration guidance
- No migration docs — v2.0 is the new baseline
- Fresh start branding ("v2.0") — assume users start fresh
- Update CHANGELOG with all v2.0 changes
- No API stability notes — all public APIs assumed stable

### Package organization
- Each package (di, config, worker) has its own README
- Full cross-linking between package READMEs and main README
- Mention standalone usage is possible but focus on integrated use with gaz App
- Show explicit imports (`import "gaz/config"`) as the primary pattern

### Claude's Discretion
- Order of documentation updates (based on what's most broken)
- Exact wording and structure within each doc
- How to organize cross-references effectively
- godoc comment style and level of detail

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Examples should demonstrate the current `For[T](c).Provider(...)` pattern exclusively
- Config examples should show explicit `import "gaz/config"` not re-exports
- Package READMEs should work as standalone docs on pkg.go.dev
- CHANGELOG should follow Keep a Changelog format (already established convention)

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
