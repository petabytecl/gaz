# Phase 14.2 Plan 03: Advanced Docs and README/CHANGELOG Updates Summary

**Updated advanced.md to For[T]() API, added worker package to README features, documented all v2.0 package additions in CHANGELOG**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T00:28:21Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T00:30:33Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Replaced all deprecated API calls in advanced.md with For[T]() pattern (24 usages)
- Added ConfigProvider interface example as replacement for removed app.WithConfig()
- Added worker package to README features list
- Documented di, config, and worker package additions in CHANGELOG

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite docs/advanced.md** - `d1ecbf4` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Update README.md with worker package** - `8c335c6` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Update CHANGELOG.md with v2.0 package additions** - `713d8cf` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `docs/advanced.md` - Replaced app.ProvideSingleton/Transient/Eager, app.WithConfig with For[T]() pattern and ConfigProvider
- `README.md` - Added "Background workers" feature line
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added "Added" section with di, config, worker packages and new features

## Decisions Made

- Showed ConfigProvider interface as the modern way to declare service config requirements (replacing app.WithConfig pattern)
- Placed worker feature after health checks in README features list (logical ordering)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness
