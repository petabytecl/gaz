# Phase 14.2 Plan 01: Foundational Documentation Rewrite Summary

**Rewrote getting-started.md and concepts.md to use For[T]() API exclusively, removing all references to deprecated app.ProvideSingleton/Transient/Eager methods**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T00:27:16Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T00:28:50Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Replaced app.ProvideSingleton() with gaz.For[*T](app.Container()).Provider() in getting-started.md
- Removed all "Using App fluent API" alternative patterns from concepts.md Service Scopes section
- Added proper error handling on registration in all code examples
- Updated App vs Container section to use For[T]() pattern
- Verified cross-references between docs still work

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite docs/getting-started.md** - `aaf6e74` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Rewrite docs/concepts.md** - `6cb774e` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `docs/getting-started.md` - Main tutorial with For[T]() API for registration and dependency resolution
- `docs/concepts.md` - Core concepts with For[T]() as sole registration API

## Decisions Made

- For[T]() is the only registration pattern shown in foundational documentation
- Error handling on registration is demonstrated in all examples (not ignored)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Foundational docs now consistent with v2.0 API
- Ready for additional documentation updates (advanced.md, configuration.md if needed)
- Users following tutorials will learn the current API pattern
