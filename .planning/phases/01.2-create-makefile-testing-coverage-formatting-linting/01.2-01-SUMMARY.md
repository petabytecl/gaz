# Phase 01.2: Create Makefile Summary

**Automated dev workflow with Makefile targets for testing/linting and GitHub Actions CI pipeline**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 
- **Completed:** 
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Standardized development workflow via Makefile
- Enforced quality standards (90% coverage, formatting, linting)
- Automated CI pipeline testing against Go 1.22, 1.23, 1.24

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Create Makefile with dev targets** - f2202a0 (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create GitHub Actions CI workflow** - 116ef54 (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (pending commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `Makefile` - Defines targets for test, cover, fmt, lint, clean, help
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for CI

## Decisions Made
- **Coverage Threshold:** Set to 90% to maintain high quality.
- **Linting:** Using `golangci-lint` as the standard linter.
- **CI Matrix:** Testing against last 3 Go versions (1.22-1.24) to ensure compatibility.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Ready for Phase 2 (Lifecycle Management).
- CI will now protect the codebase as we add new features.
